## Welcome!
This is the course page for FRS 417, **Introduction to Data Science for Biologists** at UC Davis.

## Class Times and Contact Information

## Course Summary
In FRS 417, you will be introduced to the fundamentals of data science with emphasis on data frequently used by biologists. We will use the R software environment to develop and practice key skills including data management, transformation, analysis, and visualization. Practical examples will span a range of disciplines including social science, ecology, evolution, and genetics. Labs will use a problem-solving approach where students build on previously learned skills culminating in a small, group-based project presented at the end of the quarter. 

This class is designed for students with *no background in computer programming, R, or statistics*. My assumption is that you know how to turn a computer on and use a mouse- that's it!

## Reading
[R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/), Grolemund and Wickham (2017).  

## Course Learning Goals
*At the end of this course, you will be able to:*  

1. Use R and RStudio to perform basic analyses including arithmetic and basic statistics.  
2. Work with multiple types of data in R and RStudio including vectors, data frames, and nucleotide sequences.  
3. Import and transform complex, messy data for analysis in R using `dplyr`, `tidyr`, and `purrr`.  
4. Produce a variety of plots and charts to visualize results of data analysis using `ggplot2`.  
5. Build an exploratory analysis pipeline that can be applied to a variety of data types and structures.  
6. Use Shiny to build an interactive application.  
7. Use geospacial data to produce distribution maps.
