## Learning Goals
*At the end of this exercise, you will be able to:*  
1. Run a shiny app from a stand alone script  
2. Configure a shiny app to automatically stop when closed.  
3. Add a new input to the ui.  
3. Use shinydashboard to improve ui aesthetics.

## Running A Shiny App from Script

Copy and pasting code into the console is okay for tiny example apps, but it's not feasible for large apps, especially because advanced shiny apps can be hundreds of line of code or more. The best way to work on apps is from a stand alone script. R Studio should automatically recognize the shiny app from the basic app building blocks/skeleton. All we have to do to run our app is click the "Run App" button at the top right of the editor window.  
![Run App button](runapp.png){width=300px}

## Practice

Save the finished example app from part 1 as a stand alone `.R` script. What packages do you need to make sure to load at the top? Run the app by clicking the Run App button. Set the run method in the Run App drop down to "Run External". ![Run External](runexternal.png){width=300px}

## Automatically Stopping an App

When we are building an app and frequently testing it, it can be cumbersome to always make sure to stop our app by clicking the stop button. When we close the window we want the app to also stop. This can be done with a couple lines of code that tell R to stop the app in the current session when we close the window. Add the code to our current app at the end of the server function (but inside the function) and try re running it. Your server function should look like this:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
server <- function(input, output, session) {
  
  output$plot <- renderPlot({
    ggplot(iris, aes_string(x = input$x, y = input$y, col = "Species")) + geom_point() + theme_light(base_size = 18)
  })
  
  session$onSessionEnded(stopApp)
}
```

We now have a couple things in our server function. It's always a good idea to make lots of comments in the server function so others can easily understand our code and so we ourselves can easily understand what we did at a later date.

## Practice

Make some comments in the server function to explain what each part is doing and note anything special that you want to remember later.
```{r, eval = FALSE}
server <- function(input, output, session) {
  
  # the code to make the plot of iris data grouped by species
  output$plot <- renderPlot({
    ggplot(iris, aes_string(x = input$x, y = input$y, col = "Species")) + geom_point() + theme_light(base_size = 18)
  })
  
  # stop the app when we close it
  session$onSessionEnded(stopApp)
}
```


## Adding Numeric Input

Let's try adding a new numeric input so the user can change the size of the font on the plot with a slider. We can do this with the `sliderInput()` function. The `sliderInput()` function takes a label that the server function will use to access the value, the label the ui will display to the user, a minimum and maximum value, a starting value, and a step size. Edit your script to include the slider input in the ui and for the server to access the input value. 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
ui <- fluidPage(
  
  selectInput("x", "Select X Variable", choices = c("Sepal.Length", "Sepal.Width", "Petal.Length", "Petal.Width"), 
              selected = "Petal.Width"),
  selectInput("y", "Select Y Variable", choices = c("Sepal.Length", "Sepal.Width", "Petal.Length", "Petal.Width"),
              selected = "Petal.Length"),
  sliderInput("fontsize", "Select the Font Size", min = 10, max = 24, value = 18, step = 1),
  plotOutput("plot", width = "500px", height = "400px")
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  
  # the code to make the plot of iris data grouped by species
  output$plot <- renderPlot({
    ggplot(iris, aes_string(x = input$x, y = input$y, col = "Species")) + geom_point() + theme_light(base_size = input$fontsize)
  })
  
  # stop the app when we close it
  session$onSessionEnded(stopApp)

}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```


## ui Layout with shinydashboard

We now have a functional app which does several things, but the layout doesn't look very nice. We can change that with many different methods, but shiny dashboards are simple to use and offer a lot of functionality for making apps look professional quickly. First we need to install the `shinydashboard` package.
```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("shinydashboard")
```

When working with any package on shiny ui appearance, it's important to know how the ui is laid out. The ui is laid out in a bootstrap grid pattern with 12 columns that can be subdivided into rows. The grid is contained in the `fluidPage()` of our current app. We won't use `fluidPage()` with `shinydashboard` but rather `dashboardPage()`. A shiny dashboard contains a minimum of a header, a sidebar, and a body. The `dashboardPage()` still contains the bootstrap grid. Copy and paste the dashboard skeleton in the console and run it to see that basic layout. 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(shiny)
library(shinydashboard)

ui <- dashboardPage(
  dashboardHeader(),
  dashboardSidebar(),
  dashboardBody()
)

server <- function(input, output) { }

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

Let's edit the title of our dashboard.
```{r, eval = FALSE}

ui <- dashboardPage(
  dashboardHeader(title = "Plot Iris App"),
  dashboardSidebar(),
  dashboardBody()
)

server <- function(input, output) { }

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

Let's add our ui and server elements to make a functional dashboard. We will put our ui elements in the `dashboardBody()`. Edit your app script to use the dashboard format. We won't do anything with the sidebar in this tutorial, but see the [R Studio tutorial](https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/get_started.html) for more information. 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
ui <- dashboardPage(
  dashboardHeader(title = "Plot Iris App"),
  dashboardSidebar(),
  dashboardBody(
  selectInput("x", "Select X Variable", choices = c("Sepal.Length", "Sepal.Width", "Petal.Length", "Petal.Width"), 
              selected = "Petal.Width"),
  selectInput("y", "Select Y Variable", choices = c("Sepal.Length", "Sepal.Width", "Petal.Length", "Petal.Width"),
              selected = "Petal.Length"),
  sliderInput("fontsize", "Select the Font Size", min = 10, max = 24, value = 18, step = 1),
  plotOutput("plot", width = "500px", height = "400px"))
)

server <- function(input, output, session) { 
  
  # the code to make the plot of iris data grouped by species
  output$plot <- renderPlot({
    ggplot(iris, aes_string(x = input$x, y = input$y, col = "Species")) + geom_point() + theme_light(base_size =              input$fontsize)
  })
  
  # stop the app when we close it
  session$onSessionEnded(stopApp)

  }

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

Boxes are a nice way to group inputs and display outputs in `shinydashboard`. We can display our inputs and outputs in a box with `box()`. Boxes need to be contained in a `fluidRow()`. We will use just one row. Edit your app to conatin boxes in the ui. Try not to copy and paste the app below but rather add the boxes by hand paying close attention to parentheses. 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
ui <- dashboardPage(
  dashboardHeader(title = "Plot Iris App"),
  dashboardSidebar(),
  dashboardBody(
  fluidRow(
  box(
  selectInput("x", "Select X Variable", choices = c("Sepal.Length", "Sepal.Width", "Petal.Length", "Petal.Width"), 
              selected = "Petal.Width"),
  selectInput("y", "Select Y Variable", choices = c("Sepal.Length", "Sepal.Width", "Petal.Length", "Petal.Width"),
              selected = "Petal.Length"),
  sliderInput("fontsize", "Select the Font Size", min = 10, max = 24, value = 18, step = 1)
  ), # close the first box
  box(
  plotOutput("plot", width = "500px", height = "400px")
  ) # close the second box
  ) # close the row
  ) # close the dashboard body
) # close the ui

server <- function(input, output, session) { 
  
  # the code to make the plot of iris data grouped by species
  output$plot <- renderPlot({
    ggplot(iris, aes_string(x = input$x, y = input$y, col = "Species")) + geom_point() + theme_light(base_size =              input$fontsize)
  })
  
  # stop the app when we close it
  session$onSessionEnded(stopApp)

  }

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

In the code above, each box takes up half the available space (6 columns). Let's make them narrower and add a title. Change your script to match the one below.
```{r, eval = FALSE}
ui <- dashboardPage(
  dashboardHeader(title = "Plot Iris App"),
  dashboardSidebar(),
  dashboardBody(
  fluidRow(
  box(title = "Plot Options", width = 3,
  selectInput("x", "Select X Variable", choices = c("Sepal.Length", "Sepal.Width", "Petal.Length", "Petal.Width"), 
              selected = "Petal.Width"),
  selectInput("y", "Select Y Variable", choices = c("Sepal.Length", "Sepal.Width", "Petal.Length", "Petal.Width"),
              selected = "Petal.Length"),
  sliderInput("fontsize", "Select the Font Size", min = 10, max = 24, value = 18, step = 1)
  ), # close the first box
  box(title = "Plot of Iris Data", width = 3,
  plotOutput("plot", width = "500px", height = "400px")
  ) # close the second box
  ) # close the row
  ) # close the dashboard body
) # close the ui

server <- function(input, output, session) { 
  
  # the code to make the plot of iris data grouped by species
  output$plot <- renderPlot({
    ggplot(iris, aes_string(x = input$x, y = input$y, col = "Species")) + geom_point() + theme_light(base_size =              input$fontsize)
  })
  
  # stop the app when we close it
  session$onSessionEnded(stopApp)

  }

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

Whew! We made it! We created a nice looking app with `shinydashboard`. And now we can easily see how even a basic shiny app can become messy and why it's always helpful to include lots of annotations.
